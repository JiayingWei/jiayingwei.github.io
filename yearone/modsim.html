  <h3>Modeling and Simulation</h3>
  Modeling and Simulation of the Physical World, better known as ModSim, introduced us to model building (suprise!) and coding in MATLAB. In this class we had three different projects, a population model, a thermal system model, and a mechanical system model. <br /><br />
  
  <h1>Sharks, Rays, and Scallops</h1>
  
  So apparently Sharks, Rays, and Scallops are tied together by the string of fate via the food chain. The whole premise of this project was that overfishing of sharks causes a sharp spike in Ray populations who then decimate surround scallop populations. In order to model this system we had to first understand stocks and flows, which is essentially a visual way to represent the various preditor/prey relationships between the three populations.

  I then took these relationships and translated it into code and outputed this:

  What's the point of a model if you don't use it to answer questions? I wanted to know if there was a starting ray population that would kick the whole system into equilibrium. <a href="modsim/1st_project(small).pdf" class = "link">For the long answer, try to decipher my <strong>pdf</strong></a> (sorry).<br /><br />
  
  tl;dr: No, there is isn't a starting ray population that can do this. 
  
<h1>Is Blowing on Your Soup Doing any Good?</h1>

Our second projects had to be a thermal or a pharmaketic system. In an effort to pick a system that would be relavant to our everyday lives, my partner (James) and I chose to model a bowl of soup. I mean, we as humans have been blowing on soup for centuries, is it an act of naievitity? <a href="modsim/2nd_project.pdf" class = "link">Find out, in our <strong>poster</strong>! </a>

<h1>Out of Control Hamster Balls: Hamster Survival Stories</h1>

Our final ModSim project had to be based on a mechanical system, Michael (my new partner) and I decided to model an out of control hamster ball. Normally a hamster is in full control of the motion of its hamster ball, an out of control hamster ball is a situation where the hamster ball is controlling the hamster. Our question was : <a href="modsim/3rd_project.pdf" class = "link">How long can you safely keep a hamster on a ramp of a given slope?</a><br /><br />

<h2>What Did I Take Out of ModSim?</h2>
  
  One of the main things I took away from ModSim was abstraction. In order to have a practical model done in a fesable time scale, I have to abstract out the portions that won't help answer my question. Another thing I learned was how to make the most out of meetings. It doesn't make sense to only work during meetings, meetings are more useful for briefing the other person about what has been done and what needs to be done. This way we're not wasting each other's time. Tada!
