# Making Ceramics

When I have the time, it’s always a pleasure to pick up clay again. I like how unique you can make pieces when you choose to stretch your imagination. It’s also so unpredictable, I never quite know what the end result will be until I get there. Sometimes it’s not quite what I’d hoped for, but other times I’m pleasantly surprised.
