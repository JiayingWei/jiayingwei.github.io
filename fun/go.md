# Playing Go

In my free time I like to play go. Go is one of the oldest board games in the world still played in its original form. It’s simple to learn, but is deep in strategy.

I play in person 2 times a week, and I help organize for our local go club <a href="https://eastbaygoplayers.org/" target="_blank">East Bay Go Players</a>. We have two regular meetups in Berkeley and Oakland where people gather to play together.

As our clubs keep growing, we get a lot of curious people asking us what we’re doing. I decided to make us a website, so they have a place to learn more about the game. I came up with the mascot & branding, and coded it myself.

I also host tournaments for our club. This year we screen printed t-shirts with our new mascot for prizes. We had a total of 39 participants show up. It’s always a lot of hard work to run these tournaments, but it makes me happy that our community enjoys these events :)
