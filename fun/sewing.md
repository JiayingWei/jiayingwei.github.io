# Sewing & Knitting

I got my first sewing machine in high school, but it wasn’t until the past three years where I’ve gotten more serious about making my own clothes. I really enjoy the process of picking out the pattern & fabric, and making something that is unique to only me.

I also picked up knitting around the same time... this was my 3rd attempt at getting the hobby to stick. I enjoy knitting for how mindless it can be. It’s nice to be able to turn off your brain for a while and knit a few rows.
