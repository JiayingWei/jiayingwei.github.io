## Background
BitGym had a variety of virtual tours from all over the world for people who exercised using cardio machines. Our product let people escape the four walls of their gym, and go running in Santorini, biking in Amsterdam, or rowing in the Arctic. If you’re interested in seeing all our offerings, check out the [tours page](https://www.bitgym.com/tours/).

During my time there, I made a series of illustrations for our monthly newsletter announcing new tours. Here are some of my favorites, come on a little trip with me!

## Welcome to Tokyo
Featured in this postcard is the Senso-ji gate located in Asakusa, Tokyo. Soak up the atmosphere of old Tokyo as you meander along streets lined with yummy food venders.

## Beach run in Cabo
Los Cabo’s most popular beach is a never-ending stretch of beach towels, sun umbrellas, and beach volleyball. Enjoy the course golden sand and feel free to stop for a refreshing drink after your run on the beach.

## Truckee River Run
On this Californian river tour, you’ll start off running on the railroad tracks. After awhile your path will join with the Truckee river, as you immerse yourself in greenery, birds, and the calming sound of flowing water.

## Row around Lake Bled
This spooky tour was released right around Halloween, it takes place at Lake Bled located in Slovenia. In the distance you’ll see Bled Castle which is perched on a cliff overlooking the lake.

## Christmas in Tahoe
One of my final illustrations for BitGym, this one was made around Christmas time as a holiday card of sorts. This tour takes place on Lake Tahoe in the winter. The snow capped mountains and frosty pine trees are quite picturesque.
