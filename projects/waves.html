	<h3>Leveraging design to
help busy people surf more
</h3>
	<p>
	Surfing is a fun sport that brings us closer to nature, but because of that we are also subject to her whims. Some days there are lots of waves, and some days the ocean is completely flat. There are lots of variables that can go into a surfer’s decision on whether to go surfing or not. 
	<br><br>
	There are existing apps that provide detailed meteorological data on wave height, tide graphs, sunrise &amp; sunset times which are great for people who like the nitty gritty details. However I wanted to create something that would encourage people who are intimidated by the technical aspects of surfing to just go out and surf more. To do that, I wanted to make the decision to surf as simple as possible: Do I want to go surfing at this time? Yes or No. 
	</p>
